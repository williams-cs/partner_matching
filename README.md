# partner_matching
script that pairs students randomly

## prerequisites
You must have [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.  This application was developed using .NET Core 2.2 on the macos.

## use
There is an easy-to-use shell script in the root directory called `partner_matching.sh`.  Use it as follows:

```
$ ./partner_matching <class roster CSV> <seed>
```

where <class roster CSV> is a class roster spreadsheet as generated by our good friend, [Sarah Williams](https://sarah.williams.edu) and <seed> is a seed string.  You will need to open the generated spreadsheet, which is an Excel file, and save it as a (comma-delimited) CSV.  I find it useful to use the assignment/lab name as the random seed, since we should be able to generate on demand the same pairing for the same homework assignment.

For example, 

```
$ ./partner_matching roster.csv lab1
```

## odd numbers of students

If your class has an odd number of students, you have two options.  By default, the script will pair the remaining student with a random group.  If you would like to prevent this behavior, add a dummy student record to the CSV.  Then you can pair the remaining student with another group manually after running the script.
